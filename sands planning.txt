sands

wake up in desert
one button on screen: GET UP
LOOK AROUND 
daylight meter is shown
COLLECT SAND > > > > > yields sand (no use at the moment) and grubs which are gradually consumed (? or maybe not?)


eventually sleep button is added
new button: WANDER
wandering yields found resources ("driftwood", fabric scraps)
after wandering you can WANDER again or RETURN
you must return before nightfall or you will lose a portion of what you have gathered ( not sand ) & be returned to where you started


crafting tab displayed once night spent WANDERING
first option: tent for x fabric scraps, x driftwood
tents can be brought with you while wandering to avoid loss of materials
your first denizen will be a random encounter or if you set up an extra tent on your wandering (regardless they will request it)
log at this point is just dialog


after travelling for about a week you uncover water which gives a boost in energy/"productivity" whatever.
reed begin to grow after a little while longer which you can craft into paper
paper allows you to create a history (that's the "log" equivalent -- all phrased as "today we. . . .i talked to . . .. .  etc." with times of day
you also discover clay which can be used to craft pots to increase storage (very low at this point on foot.) each material requires a pot of it's own, each denizen can carry two pots


future: animals (travel/breeding/for meat and milk, etc.)
rotation:
gather . . sleep . . wander . . tent . . denizens . . oasis . . paper & clay . . histories . . DROVERS . . sculpting . .

RESOURCES: 
sand (manual gathering, each denizen increases gathering rate)
  


UI:

            SUN

        LIGHT 10.4%               <==== updates every game tick, LIGHT meter determines modifier on gathering . ..  

tooooo dark at night but various blessings etc can probably change that
-- e.g., torch gives you some boost in light (light can't drop below 25%? idk, and various other light boosts, like random firefly events etc.)
-- sleep perhaps not necessary but since you can't gather much or perhaps wander at night it's best practice to go to bed anyways, and denizens will 
   go to sleep during the night so you can't interact with them anyways
-- wild card blessings change the wave to like,,,, a tangent? some crazy shit lyke that idk


NUMBERS:
all show modified value but you can hover over to see bonuses, etc.

SCULPTING:
will exercised through blessed clay
passively collects resources initially at a rate lower than clicking. (can be dedicated to collecting clay, reeds, sand, etc.)
dry out over time and need to be refreshed in some manner (depreciated sculptures turn into sand eventually, can be refreshed with . . .?)
-- need to be refreshed with a non clay resource so they can't be self sustaining
